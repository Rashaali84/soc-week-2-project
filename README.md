## Summary
 ## Here you are a summery of what I struggled with, what I learned, and what skills I need to practice further.

| __My Learning points__ | As a front-end developer I learned how to create a website from scratch using a template like flexboxgrid , it was really fun and so easy to use .it has som many features that can make your website really bautiful will less time and effort , not to mention the responsive edge !

| __Skills to be practiced more__ | As a web developer I get more comfortable in using git commands form git bash terminal and the right sequence of pushing and pulling and branching .Also I learned how writing user stories ahead to organize my work in the project, in addition to using felxboxgrid template as a base for a website html design.

| __Struggles__ | no struggle , but I used a tool call fire-fox web accessibility to check my project accessibilty features and it was really informative to check all the log generated by this type of tools .
Thank you ...
